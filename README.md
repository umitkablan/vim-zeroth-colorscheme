======================

# Overview

Zeroth Color Scheme (0CS) is a vim utility plugin to help you manage your colorscheme files which are stored online somewhere at github, bitbucket. You do not need a pathogen-like system to manage such very limited (actually only one) files.

Although Vundle/Neobunle addons are really helpful for managing plugins they are so heavy to orchestrate colorschemes yet to treat colorscheme files as plugins are nonsense.

With 0CS you do not have to manage your colorschemes as plugins. Trying a new color is easy as writing its name and watching it downloads before it is applied.

# How It Works

When you load 0CS a configuration file is also loaded which will have colorscheme lines with accompanying data like where they are located at. 0CS will help you try out those skins fast.
